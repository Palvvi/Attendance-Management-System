#Attendance Management System

An attendance management system (AMS) is an advanced software solution
that has been developed to track, record, and manage attendance digitally.
The admin or teachers can mark the attendance of students, add the students,
see the list of students and generate attendance reports. The admin can add
teachers and assign classes to it. The teacher can do the login and mark
attendance of his/her class. The teacher can also add student to his/her class.
The admin can see list of all the teachers and can add more teachers. The
admin can mark attendance of students too when the teacher is absent or not
able to mark attendance of students.
This reduces the burden to maintain lengthy attendance registers in school. A
teacher or admin can see the attendance report of students of any date. Even
if the attendance is mark wrong, the teacher or admin can update the
attendance without any problem. It's designed to automate and streamline the
process of keeping track of students' attendance.
